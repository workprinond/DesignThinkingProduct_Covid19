2. SUS SCORE
i. User 1: 95
ii. User 2: 92.5
iii. User 3: 95
iv. User 4: 90
Average SUS Score: (95 + 92.5 + 95 + 90)/4 = 93.125 which falls under “Excellent” grade.
Reference for calculation from pdfs:
• X = Sum of the points for all odd-numbered questions – 5
• Y = 25 – Sum of the points for all even-numbered questions
• SUS Score = (X + Y) x 2.5

Rating Scale - Strongly agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree

2. 1-1-1-2
75 percent found the app simple, clear and lucid to use. Another 25 also found it a bit difficult, but in general found it useful. It is maybe because of the figma static interaction.
3. 4-5-5-4
50 percent found app easy to use and straightforward, another 50 percent a bit less. This might be because of the learning curve associated with the scheduling from both perspectives.
4. 1-1-1-1
100 percent of the users needed no assistance for their interaction in the app.
5. 5-5-5-5
100 percent of the users found the various features and functions to be properly structured and integrated.
6. 1-1-2-2
Almost all the users found the app to be consistent in terms of looks, flow, features.
7. 4-4-5-5
Everyone agreed and believed that there is not much learning curve involved in the feature and component learning of the app.
8. 1-1-1-1
100 percent of the users did not find the app to be confusing and difficult. According to them it was very simple and easy to use.
9. 5-5-5-5
As soon as I gave the users the task, all of them (100 percent) did it without taking much time. Hence, they were quite confident. This shows they were pretty fluent and used to the app design and its flow, this maybe because of the UI which is similar to modern day apps.
10. 1-1-1-1
As mentioned before also, they started doing tasks in the app without much time taken and without any hint. This shows their fluency and the fact did not need to learn so much in the app.
Overall Verdict and analysis:
It seems maybe because of the UI design which all appreciated, helped as a catalyst to make their experience in the interaction and performing tasks better. Only one user at one of the question got a bit confused, but later he understood the process and understood it in the second half of the partner perspective. This I feel is a part of the learning curve when the user analyses the app in terms of himself/herself and his/her partner.
